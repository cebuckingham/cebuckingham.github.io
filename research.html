  <h2>Research</h2>
  <p>My research can broadly be classified as following into two categories: oceanic mesoscale and submesoscale dynamics. By these terms, we refer to different dynamical regimes. For instance, the term <em class="main-bold-font">mesoscale</em> refers to ocean features characterised by (i) horizontal scales of tens to hundreds of kilometers and (ii) temporal scales of days to months. These are the typical signals seen from space, for instance, from active microwave altimeters and passive microwave radiometers. This dynamical regime corresponds to nearly two-dimensional flow in which the dominant forces acting on a fluid parcels are those due to Earth's rotation and horizontal and vertical pressure gradients, and gravity. In contrast, the <em class="main-bold-font">submesoscale</em> regime corresponds to ocean features characterised by scales of hundreds of meters to tens of kilometers and days to months. At these scales, other forces in the equations of motion become equally as important. Below is a brief description of my research in these areas.</p>

    <h3>Submesoscale processes &amp; dissipative turbulence</h3>
    <p><em class="main-bold-font">Deep ocean -- </em>I am presently a Marie Sklodowska-Curie Individual Fellow at the University of Bretagne Occidentale near Brest, France. I am learning how to model oceanic flows in realistic configurations. Together with Jonathan Gula, we are seeking to understand what controls turbulence within a deep-sea canyon in the southern Weddell Sea. To better constrain our simulations, we are using moored instruments and ship-collected measurements that my colleagues and I collected in 2017 (<a href="https://dynopocruise2017.blogspot.com/">link</a>).</p>
    <p><em class="main-bold-font">The stability of coherent, rapidly-rotating vortices -- </em>In the process of my European research fellowship, I began to investigate the stability of rapidly-rotating flows. This generalizes an analytical result dating from the 1970s, which may help explain a question that scientists have had for 4 decades. This is work together with Jonathan Gula and Xavier Carton.</p>
    <p><em class="main-bold-font">Upper ocean -- </em>One my research interests is what controls turbulence in the upper oceans.
      Recent research has suggested that submesoscale processes may generate turbulence in the ocean surface boundary layer. Our research
      has shown that (at least at 50-m depth in the eastern North Atlantic) that surface-forced turbulence due to winds, waves, surface buoyancy loss are an
    order of magnitude larger than those due to submesoscale-forced turbulence. The caveat is that this is only true in the open ocean--i.e. away from strong mean flows and boundary currents. This being said, we also found that the energy dissipated by symmetric instability is non-negligible, perhaps approaching values of 10-20% of the wind-work into the oceans. The conclusion is that surface processes dominate vertical turbulent energy budgets but that submesoscale processes are likely important for horizontal energy budgets, having a potentially significant effect upon large-scale ocean circulation with implications for ocean-heat exchange. This work is summarized <a href="papers/Buckingham_etal_2019.pdf">here</a>.</p>

    <h3>Mesoscale oceanography: eddies and zonal jets</h3>
    <p>My dissertation research centred around the use of satellite  measurements to investigate whether or not jets exist in the oceans. Often referred to as <em>striations</em> or <em>bands</em>, these jet-like features are only observed in time averaged fields, such as sea surface height (SSH) and sea surface temperature (SST) shown to the left. They are ubiquitous in the global ocean, are associated with eastward- and westward-flowing currents, and have magnitudes comparable or smaller than the mesoscale eddy field. Our research has focused on the detection and discrimination of jets from the surrounding mesoscale eddies in mid-latitudes, where we find much of this energy is attributed to the mesoscale eddy field. This work is summarized in two papers, one pertaining to <a href="papers/Buckingham_Cornillon_2013.pdf">SSH</a> and the other <a href="papers/Buckingham_etal_2014.pdf">SST</a>.
    </p>
    <p>It is possible that jets similar to those on Jupiter exist in the global oceans. Their existence is predicted from  theory but they remain elusive in the oceans. One reason may be energy loss due to <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2017JC012910/full">baroclinic instabilities</a> that occurs on the periphery of mesoscale eddies. Another is symmetric instability initiated by <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2010GL044680/abstract">sustained winds and buoyancy fluxes at ocean fronts</a>. Finally, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/jfm.2011.345" target="new">increased drag as a result of bottom topography</a> might also explain this.</p>
    <p>Below is a link to a movie of ocean fronts in the global ocean. SST front probability was determined by applying an ocean front detection algorithm (Cayula and Cornillon 1992) to swath measurements from AMSR-E SST over a 3-week period. Each movie frame corresponds to an averaging period of 3 weeks, although the animation step is one week so as to make the field evolve gradually (i.e., 67% overlap). See <a href="papers/Buckingham_etal_2014.pdf">Buckingham et al. (2014)</a> for additional information.</p>

    <h3>Ocean remote sensing from unmanned aircraft</h3>
    <p>Although described here as a research topic, this is really an area under development. So much of observational oceanography is &quot;traditional&quot;. That is, one goes out on ships and measures temperature, salinity and pressure in the ocean. This is essential but a lot of information can be gleaned from remote sensing imagery. Given my engineering background, I am trying hard to supplement ship-based measurements of submesoscale phenomena with aerial measurements of the same. These phenomena have a tremendous impact on dispersion of surfactants and an aerial observing system (AOS) such as this would be useful for emergency response situations. This work stemmed from a research project in which <a href="papers/Buckingham_etal_2017.pdf" target="new">infrared imagery was used in conjunction with <em>in situ</em> measurements</a> to diagnose observations of a submesoscale frontal instability. Had a clear-sky  image not been available from satellite, we would not have observed the front in this manner.</p>
  <p>The most promising integrated system I have seen so-far is <a href="https://aerovel.com/" target="new">this</a>, although <a href="https://annuaire.ifremer.fr/cv/16950/en/" target="new">researchers at UBO/UCLA</a> have developed an impressive research-grade imaging system.</p>
