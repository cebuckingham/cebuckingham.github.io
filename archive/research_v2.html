    <h3>Geostrophic turbulence: eddies and  jets in the  oceans</h3>
    <p>My dissertation research centred around the use of satellite  measurements to investigate whether or not jets exist in the oceans. Often referred to as <em><a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2012JC008231/full">striations</a></em> or <em>bands</em>, these jet-like features are only observed in time averaged fields, such as sea surface height (SSH) and sea surface temperature (SST) shown to the left. They are ubiquitous in the global ocean, are associated with eastward- and westward-flowing currents, and have magnitudes comparable or smaller than the mesoscale eddy field. Our research has focused on the detection and discrimination of jets from the surrounding mesoscale eddies, where we find much of this energy is attributed to the mesoscale eddy field.</p>
    <p>It is possible that jets similar to those on Jupiter exist in the global oceans. Their existence is predicted from  theory but they remain elusive in the oceans. One reason may be energy loss due to <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2017JC012910/full">baroclinic instabilities</a> that occurs on the periphery of mesoscale eddies. Another is <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2010GL044680/abstract">winds blowing down ocean fronts</a>. Finally, <a href="http://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~pberloff/" target="new">Pavel Berloff</a> has suggested that <a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/jfm.2011.345" target="new">increased drag as a result of bottom topography</a> might also explain this.</p>

    <h3>Frontal instabilities and enhanced dissipation at ocean fronts</h3>
    <p>Another research topic that collaborators and I have studied is  submesoscale frontal instabilities. These include gravitational, symmetric, and centrifugal instabilities that occur when <em>fq</em> &lt; 0, where <em>f</em> is the Coriolis parameter and <em>q</em> is the so-called Ertel potential vorticity (PV). It can be thought as the continuum mechanics analogue of angular momentum, such that when a top spins (or when <em>q</em> = 0), it is susceptible to slight perturbations in surface roughness or atmospheric disturbances. Eventually, these perturbations grow to an extent that they result in turbulence. <a href="papers/Buckingham_etal_2016a.pdf">Observations of the first set of instabilities have been shown to be  particularly pronounced during winter</a>. A follow-up study demonstrates why this is so and that they are brought about by down-front winds, with symmetric instability playing an important role. A second type of instability occurs at ocean fronts but that is less dissipative in nature -- baroclinic instability. An example of such an instability has been documented in a <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2017JC012910/abstract" target="new">study involving a cloud-free satellite image coincident with ship-based <em>in situ </em>measurements of an unstable front</a>. Finally, X. Yu is  investigating vertical velocities from moorings and is in the process of writing up his PhD thesis.</p>

    <h3>Ocean remote sensing</h3>
    <p>Although described here as a research topic, this is really an area under development. So much of observational oceanography is &quot;traditional&quot;. That is, one goes out on ships and measures temperature, salinity and pressure in the ocean. This is essential but a lot of information can be gleaned from remote sensing imagery. Given my engineering background, I am trying hard to supplement ship-based measurements of submesoscale phenomena  with aerial measurements of the same. These phenomena have a tremendous impact on dispersion of surfactants and an aerial observing system (AOS) such as this would be useful for emergency response situations. This work stemmed from a research project in which <a href="papers/Buckingham_etal_2017.pdf" target="new">infrared imagery was used in conjunction with <em>in situ</em> measurements</a> to diagnose observations of a submesoscale frontal instability. Had a clear-sky  image not been available from satellite, we would not have  observed the  front in this manner.</p>
